    <p>Scroll slow... then scroll fast. GhostLogger calculates your scroll speed as %/sec.</p>

  <div class="container mt-5">
    <!-- Over 100 scrollable lines -->
 <p>Scroll Test Line 11: This data helps us understand user flow.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 12: Most users donâ€™t scroll past 50% of a page.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 13: But those who do are highly engaged.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 14: Scroll metrics > time on page alone.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 15: Youâ€™re currently helping us demo this in real time.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 16: Every line helps extend the scroll depth.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 17: And simulate a realistic reading experience.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 18: Try stopping now and checking scroll velocity.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 19: Then scroll quickly and reload later to compare.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 20: Weâ€™re now getting into the mid-zone of the page.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 21: Donâ€™t worry, thereâ€™s more content below.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 22: This is purely for testing scroll behavior.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 23: Still here? You're an elite scroller.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 24: Our API logs this as a full engagement.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 25: It's silent â€” nothing distracts the user.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 26: No popups, no alerts, no interference.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 27: Just you and your scroll wheel.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 28: Or your thumb if you're on mobile.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 29: Scroll velocity varies by device and user.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 30: That makes it a useful fingerprint metric.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 31: Are you a power scroller or a careful reader?</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 32: This paragraph means nothing. It's here to serve scroll science.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 33: You can test this over and over. Logs only happen on exit.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 34: Want to impress your boss? Show them scroll data in CSV.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 35: You can pair scroll velocity with click maps too.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 36: Or compare between landing page variants.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 37: This works great for blogs, sales pages, and courses.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 38: Imagine knowing who reads vs who just bounces.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 39: GhostLogger can help track that in seconds.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 40: Now take a breath... then keep scrolling.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 41: Youâ€™re building a scroll profile as we speak.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 42: Each line reinforces that the user is active.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 43: If scroll depth stops at line 20, they bailed.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 44: If they reach here, theyâ€™re likely curious.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 45: Add value to your analytics with scroll data.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 46: Time-based metrics are often misleading alone.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 47: Scroll shows momentum and interaction.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 48: Clicks show decision, scroll shows curiosity.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 49: Thatâ€™s why scroll velocity matters.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 50: Youâ€™re now 2/3 of the way to our test bottom.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 51: This content is clean, simple, and effective.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 52: Just words. No distractions. Pure scroll signal.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 53: GhostLogger respects the user experience.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 54: No heavy JS frameworks. No flickering popups.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 55: Just one `.js` file and a clean payload to your API.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 56: And of course, this deep page for demo purposes.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 57: Youâ€™ve made it farther than 90% of users.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 58: Want a reward? Click that Back to Home button later.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 59: Almost done. Scroll velocity is peaking.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 60: If you stopped midway, it would drop.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 61: Thatâ€™s why we measure max velocity too.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 62: Use this for A/B testing across variants.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 63: Or for spotting rage scrolls or bot traffic.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 64: GhostLoggerâ€™s strength is that itâ€™s passive.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 65: No friction. No intrusive tracking.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 66: Youâ€™re just doing what users naturally do.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 67: And we're capturing that in clean data.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 68: Welcome to low-latency scroll intelligence.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 69: Only a few more lines to go...</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 70: Take a breath â€” this has been a long scroll.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 71: Keep going. You're almost there.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 72: The bottom is within reach.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 73: These lines simulate real article structure.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 74: GhostLogger could be embedded in any site.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 75: From portfolios to product launches.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 76: All we need is a user, a scroll, and an exit.</p>
<p>Scroll Test Line 77: Thatâ€™s it. No extra effort.</p>
    <p>Scroll Test Line 12: Burst scrolls generate much higher scroll velocity.</p>
    <p>Scroll Test Line 13: Great for detecting real vs skimming behavior.</p>
    <p>Scroll Test Line 14: Your session data will include scroll_velocity.</p>
    <p>Scroll Test Line 15: GhostLogger logs this data only on exit.</p>
    <p>Scroll Test Line 16: Donâ€™t worry, no data is sent until you leave.</p>
    <p>Scroll Test Line 17: Try refreshing â€” no duplicate logs happen.</p>
    <p>Scroll Test Line 18: Useful for dashboards, content, landing pages.</p>
    <p>Scroll Test Line 19: Scroll tracking is essential for UI testing.</p>
    <p>Scroll Test Line 20: You're doing great. Keep going.</p>
