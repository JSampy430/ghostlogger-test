    <h2>About This Project</h2>
    <p>This simulates a user journey to test GhostLogger in real-world scenarios like reading or page-hopping.</p>
    <p>It was inspired by the need for privacy-focused analytics that still capture real engagement. Broski realized that scroll depth, time spent, and click patterns reveal a lot more than just IP addresses or cookies.</p>
    <p>"One time, a user spent 3 minutes on a page, barely scrolled, then clicked every button — we learned more from that than from 1000 bounce rates," Broski once said.</p>
    <p>Here you'll find those stories, tests, and results in action.</p>

    <h2>Case Study: The Page That Tricked Us</h2>
    <p>We once built a landing page we thought was perfect. High visuals, clean layout, modern CTA — but it flopped.</p>
    <p>Then GhostLogger showed us: everyone scrolled fast, reached 90% in under 10 seconds, and didn’t stay at the bottom. Turns out, it was too clean. No info. Just vibes.</p>
    <p>We reworked it, added actual benefits near the middle, and scroll velocity dropped. Time-at-bottom jumped. Boom — conversions doubled.</p>

    <h2>Feature Breakdown</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>📊 Scroll velocity</li>
      <li>📍 Scroll depth</li>
      <li>🖱️ Click tracking</li>
      <li>🧠 Time at bottom</li>
      <li>📑 Page views</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We use no cookies, no fingerprinting — just behavior you choose to show. What you scroll, how you scroll, and where you drop off. All tracked safely.</p>

    <h2>Bonus Section: Just Keep Scrolling</h2>
    <p>We added this block just to give you something to scroll through. Here's a little story:</p>
    <p>Once upon a time, there was a ghost named Tracker. He was invisible, polite, and deeply curious. But unlike other trackers, he didn't snoop or spy. He just watched from the shadows — gently noting where you stopped, where you clicked, and how fast you zoomed through the digital world.</p>
    <p>GhostLogger was born from his legacy — to understand without invading.</p>
    <p>“People don’t bounce because they’re lazy,” Tracker said. “They bounce because we didn’t guide them.”</p>
    <p>So here we are. Testing what works. Scroll on.</p>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <p><strong>GDPR compliant?</strong> ✅ Yes, we collect no personal data.</p>
    <p><strong>Cookie required?</strong> ❌ Nope. Not even a crumb.</p>
    <p><strong>Can I test this locally?</strong> ✅ Absolutely. Open with any browser, and logs still work (as long as the server is up).</p>
